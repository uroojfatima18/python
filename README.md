**Python**

This repository documents my Python learning journey — covering core to advanced topics such as:

- Python Basics
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Dataclasses
- Async/Await Programming
- Pydantic for data validation


## Basics

✅ Variables, Data Types, Operators
✅ Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
✅ Loops (for, while)
✅ Functions and Scopes
✅ Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
✅ Error Handling with try-except
✅ File Handling (open, read, write)

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

✅ Classes and Objects
✅ Constructors (__init__)
✅ Instance and Class Variables
✅ Inheritance and Polymorphism
✅ Encapsulation and Abstraction
✅ Magic/Dunder Methods (__str__, __repr__, etc.)

## Dataclasses
A cleaner and more readable alternative to regular classes.

✅ Why use dataclasses?
✅ @dataclass decorator
✅ Converting to/from dictionaries


## Async / Await (Asynchronous Programming)
Write non-blocking, concurrent Python code.

✅ Difference between synchronous vs asynchronous
✅ async def functions
✅ await keyword
✅ Event loops & asyncio.run()
✅ asyncio.gather() and asyncio.sleep()
✅ Real-world examples: APIs and delays

## Pydantic
Data validation using Python type hints.

✅ BaseModel and Field Validation
✅ Nested Models
✅ Custom Validators
✅ Parsing JSON to Models
✅ Useful in FastAPI and APIs

I have not only learned these concepts but also applied them through various **basic and advanced projects** to strengthen my understanding.  
Currently, I am using Python to build intelligent systems, including **AI agents**, as part of my ongoing learning in **Agentic AI and automation**.
