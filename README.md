# Python

This repository documents my Python learning journey â€” covering core to advanced topics such as:

- Python Basics
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Dataclasses
- Async/Await Programming
- Pydantic for data validation


## Basics

- Variables, Data Types, Operators    
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)    
- Loops (for, while)    
- Functions and Scopes    
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets    
- Error Handling with try-except    
- File Handling (open, read, write)    

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

- Classes and Objects    
- Constructors (__init__)    
- Instance and Class Variables    
- Inheritance and Polymorphism    
- Encapsulation and Abstraction    
- Magic/Dunder Methods (__str__, __repr__, etc.)    

## Dataclasses
A cleaner and more readable alternative to regular classes.

- Why use dataclasses?    
- @dataclass decorator    
- Converting to/from dictionaries    


## Async / Await (Asynchronous Programming)
Write non-blocking, concurrent Python code.

- Difference between synchronous vs asynchronous    
- async def functions    
- await keyword    
- Event loops & asyncio.run()    
- asyncio.gather() and asyncio.sleep()    
- Real-world examples: APIs and delays    

## Pydantic
Data validation using Python type hints.

- BaseModel and Field Validation
- Nested Models
- Custom Validators
- Parsing JSON to Models
-Useful in FastAPI and APIs

I have not only learned these concepts but also applied them through various **basic and advanced projects** to strengthen my understanding.  
Currently, I am using Python to build intelligent systems, including **AI agents**, as part of my ongoing learning in **Agentic AI and automation**.
